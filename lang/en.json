Settlements and nomadic cities sheltered by massive walls formed a new foundation for our civilization. But the vast wildlands and uninhabited territories stretching far beyond the colonies of the Habitable Band have yet to be surveyed. As such, most of this world remain untamed.",

You will lead a professional team of Endfield Industries operators. Explore this world, conquer this land, recover lost technologies, and unearth secrets hidden within the abandoned ruins.\n\nWelcome to Talos-II and your new home at Endfield Industries. A new era of change has dawned upon this ancient world. Time to make your choice.\nGood luck."
